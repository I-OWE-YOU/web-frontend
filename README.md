## Project setup

`npm install`

or

`yarn install`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

`npm run serve`

### Compiles and minifies for production

`npm run build`

### Lints and fixes files

`yarn lint`

Also, a lint-staged preCommit gitHook will run prettier and stylelint before
being able to commit inconsistencies, so check the Git output in your console
if you're unable to stage your changes.
